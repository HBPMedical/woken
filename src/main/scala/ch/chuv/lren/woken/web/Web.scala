/**
  * Provides the web server (spray-can) for the REST api in ``Api``, using the actor system
  * defined in ``Core``.
  *
  * You may sometimes wish to construct separate ``ActorSystem`` for the web server machinery.
  * However, for this simple application, we shall use the same ``ActorSystem`` for the
  * entire application.
  *
  * Benefits of separate ``ActorSystem`` include the ability to use completely different
  * configuration, especially when it comes to the threading core.model.
