/**
 * Provides the web server (spray-can) for the REST api in ``Api``, using the actor system
 * defined in ``Core``.
 *
 * You may sometimes wish to construct separate ``ActorSystem`` for the web server machinery.
 * However, for this simple application, we shall use the same ``ActorSystem`` for the
 * entire application.
 *
 * Benefits of separate ``ActorSystem`` include the ability to use completely different
 * configuration, especially when it comes to the threading core.model.
